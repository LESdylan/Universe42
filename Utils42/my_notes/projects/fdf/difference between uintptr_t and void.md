While `uintptr_t` and `void*` are related in that they both deal with pointers in C, they are not the same thing. The comparison arises because `uintptr_t` is often used in conjunction with pointers, as seen in the `get_palette_color` function where `void*` is cast to `uintptr_t`. Let’s clarify the relationship, differences, and how they’re used, especially in the context of the function you provided.

### Key Points of Comparison

- **`void*`**:
  - A generic pointer type in C that can point to any data type (e.g., `int`, `struct`, etc.).
  - It represents a memory address but carries no information about the type or size of the data it points to.
  - Size: Matches the system’s pointer size (e.g., 32 bits on a 32-bit system, 64 bits on a 64-bit system).
  - Used for: Type-agnostic pointer storage, passing pointers to functions, or abstracting data types.

- **`uintptr_t`**:
  - An unsigned integer type defined in `<stdint.h>` (C99 and later) that is guaranteed to be large enough to hold the value of a `void*` pointer.
  - It is not a pointer; it’s an integer that can store the numerical value of a pointer (i.e., the memory address).
  - Size: Matches the system’s pointer size (e.g., 32 bits on a 32-bit system, 64 bits on a 64-bit system).
  - Used for: Converting pointers to integers for arithmetic, storage, or manipulation in a portable way.

### Are They "Like" Each Other?

They are related in that `uintptr_t` is designed to hold the value of a `void*` pointer, but they serve different purposes:
- `void*` is a pointer type used to reference memory.
- `uintptr_t` is an integer type used to store the numerical value of a pointer’s address.

You can think of `uintptr_t` as a bridge between pointers and integers. It allows you to safely convert a `void*` to an integer (e.g., for calculations or storage) and back to a pointer without losing information, assuming the conversion is done correctly.

### Context in `get_palette_color`

In the function:
```c
uint32_t get_palette_color(t_pivot *color, float t)
{
    if (t < 0.5f)
        return (blend_rgb(
                (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)color->low,
                (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)color->mid,
                t / 0.5f
        ));
    else
        return (blend_rgb(
                (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)color->mid,
                (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)color->high,
                (t - 0.5f) / 0.5f
        ));
}
```
The `t_pivot` structure uses `void*` for `color->low`, `color->mid`, and `color->high`, which are cast to `uintptr_t` and then to `uint32_t`. Here’s how `void*` and `uintptr_t` interact:

1. **Use of `void*`**:
   - The `low`, `mid`, and `high` fields are `void*`, meaning they are pointers. However, in this function, they don’t point to actual memory locations; instead, they store color values (e.g., `0xFF0000` for red) disguised as pointers.
   - For example, `color->low = (void*)0xFF0000` means the pointer’s value is the integer `0xFF0000`, which represents a color, not an address of a color stored elsewhere.

2. **Role of `uintptr_t`**:
   - The cast `(uintptr_t)color->low` converts the `void*` to an integer (`uintptr_t`) that holds the numerical value of the pointer (e.g., `0xFF0000`).
   - This is necessary because you can’t directly cast a `void*` to a `uint32_t` in a portable way (e.g., on a 64-bit system, a `void*` is 64 bits, and casting directly to `uint32_t` would truncate the value).
   - `uintptr_t` ensures the pointer’s value is preserved as an integer that matches the system’s pointer size.

3. **Final Cast to `uint32_t`**:
   - The subsequent cast `(uint32_t)(uintptr_t)color->low` converts the `uintptr_t` to a `uint32_t`, which is the expected type for the color value passed to `blend_rgb`.
   - This assumes the `void*` value (e.g., `0xFF0000`) is a valid 32-bit color, which is true in this case since the `t_pivot` structure is being used to store colors as pointer values.

### Why Use `void*` and `uintptr_t` Together?

The use of `void*` in the `t_pivot` structure and the cast to `uintptr_t` in the function is an unusual design choice for storing colors. Here’s why they might be used together:

1. **Flexibility of `void*`**:
   - `void*` is a generic pointer type, so the `t_pivot` structure could theoretically store pointers to actual memory (e.g., a color struct or lookup table) rather than raw color values.
   - In this case, the `void*` fields are being repurposed to store `uint32_t` color values directly (e.g., `(void*)0xFF0000`), which is a non-standard but functional approach.

2. **Portability with `uintptr_t`**:
   - Casting `void*` to `uintptr_t` ensures the pointer’s value is converted to an integer in a portable way, regardless of whether the system is 32-bit or 64-bit.
   - Without `uintptr_t`, a direct cast like `(uint32_t)color->low` could truncate a 64-bit pointer on a 64-bit system, leading to incorrect or undefined behavior.

3. **Intermediate Step for Safety**:
   - The C standard recommends using `uintptr_t` for pointer-to-integer conversions to avoid issues with pointer size mismatches.
   - For example, on a 64-bit system:
     - `color->low` (a `void*`) might be `0x00000000FF0000` (64 bits, with the color value `0xFF0000` in the lower 32 bits).
     - `(uintptr_t)color->low` yields `0x00000000FF0000` (a 64-bit integer).
     - `(uint32_t)(uintptr_t)color->low` yields `0xFF0000` (the correct 32-bit color value).

### Differences Between `void*` and `uintptr_t`

|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Type**              | Pointer type                            | Unsigned integer type                    |
| **Purpose**           | References a memory address             | Holds the numerical value of a pointer   |
| **Size**              | Matches system’s pointer size (32 or 64 bits) | Matches system’s pointer size (32 or 64 bits) |
| **Usage**             | Points to data of any type              | Stores pointer value for manipulation    |
| **Operations**        | Pointer arithmetic, dereferencing       | Integer arithmetic, bitwise operations   |
| **Standard**          | Part of core C language                 | Defined in `<stdint.h>` (C99+)           |
| **Example**           | `void* ptr = (void*)0xFF0000;`          | `uintptr_t val = (uintptr_t)ptr;`        |

### Why Not Just Use `void*` or `uint32_t` Directly?

- **Why not store `uint32_t` in `t_pivot`?**
  - Instead of `void* low;`, the structure could use `uint32_t low;`, eliminating the need for casting. This would be clearer and safer, as it explicitly indicates that `low`, `mid`, and `high` are colors, not pointers.
  - Possible reasons for using `void*`:
    - The `t_pivot` structure might be reused for other purposes where `low`, `mid`, and `high` are actual pointers.
    - Legacy code or a design choice to make the structure generic.
    - Misdesign, as storing colors as `void*` is unconventional and prone to errors.

- **Why not skip `uintptr_t`?**
  - Casting directly from `void*` to `uint32_t` (e.g., `(uint32_t)color->low`) is not portable and may cause truncation on 64-bit systems.
  - `uintptr_t` ensures the pointer’s value is converted to an integer safely before narrowing to `uint32_t`.

### Example in Context

Suppose:
- `color->low = (void*)0xFF0000` (red, stored as a pointer value).
- On a 64-bit system, `color->low` is a 64-bit pointer: `0x00000000FF0000`.
- The cast `(uintptr_t)color->low` yields `0x00000000FF0000` (a 64-bit integer).
- The cast `(uint32_t)(uintptr_t)color->low` yields `0xFF0000` (a 32-bit integer, the correct color value).
- This value is passed to `blend_rgb` as a color (e.g., red).

On a 32-bit system, the process is similar, but `void*` and `uintptr_t` are both 32 bits, so no truncation occurs.

### Potential Issues

1. **Misuse of `void*`**:
   - Storing color values as `void*` is confusing and error-prone. If `color->low` were accidentally set to a real memory address (e.g., `0x7FFF12345678`), the cast to `uint32_t` would produce an invalid color value.
   - A `uint32_t` field would be safer and more explicit.

2. **Portability Concerns**:
   - The cast to `uint32_t` assumes the `void*` value fits in 32 bits. If the `t_pivot` structure were misused to store actual pointers, the cast could truncate 64-bit addresses, leading to incorrect colors.

3. **Undefined Behavior**:
   - If `color->low`, `color->mid`, or `color->high` are uninitialized or invalid pointers, the cast to `uintptr_t` and `uint32_t` could produce undefined behavior.

### Summary

- **`void*`** is a generic pointer type used in `t_pivot` to store color values (e.g., `0xFF0000`) disguised as pointers.
- **`uintptr_t`** is an integer type used as an intermediate step to safely convert the `void*` value to a `uint32_t` color value, ensuring portability across 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
- They are not the same: `void*` is for pointing to memory, while `uintptr_t` is for holding a pointer’s numerical value as an integer.
- In `get_palette_color`, `uintptr_t` is used to make the `void*`-to-`uint32_t` conversion robust, but the use of `void*` for colors is unconventional and could be simplified by using `uint32_t` directly in the `t_pivot` structure.
