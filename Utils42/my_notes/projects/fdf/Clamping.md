A clamping algorithm in geometry refers to computational processes taht apply constraints or limitations in a manufacturing, design, or image processing context often by analyzing and manipulating the geometry of objects, forces or image features. These algorithms automate taks like determining optimal camping points for workpieces to prevent movement, locating the precise center for micro-gripper to precisely grip an object, or ensring a  value in a simulation remains wihtin predefined geometric boundaries.
