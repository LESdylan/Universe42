A matrix **A** is an `m x n` rectangular array of numbers with m rows and n columns.

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \dots a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} \dots a_{2n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} \dots a_{2n} \\ .\\ .\\.\\
a_{m_{1}} & a_{m_{2}} \dots a_{m_{m}} \\ \\

\end{bmatrix}
$$

A matrix is often viewes as consisting of a number of row or column matrices. Row matrices and column matrices are also often referred to as `row vectors` and `column vectors`, respectively.
