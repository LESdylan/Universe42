# Finding the slope of a line
![[Pasted image 20250827172621.png]]

The **slope-intercept formula** of a lineis given by `y = mx + b`, where `m` and `b` are fixed numbers. The set of points satisfying this equation describes a straight line in the `xy-plane`

The slope of al line is the ratio between the changes of `y`and the change of `x`. For example, for two different  points on a line `p1 = (x1,y1)` and `p2 = (x2,y2)` the slope is equal to the ratio 
$$
\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}
$$
This is also known as the [[linear rate of change]]  of `y` with respect to `x`

[[slope]] is sometimes expressed as rise over run. Students who forget which component is the enumerator might want to visualize determining slope as walking up a flight of stairs. The vertica change comes first(is the enumerator), and if followed by the horizontal change (the denominator)

For the line y = mx + b, the rate of change of y with respect to x is always equal to the slope `m` for any pair of distinct points on the line, which can be calculated as follows:

$$
\frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}} = \frac{(mx_{2} + b) - (mx_{1} + b)}{x_{2} - x_{1}} = \frac{m(x_{2} - x_{1})}{x_{2} - x_{1}} = m
$$
> [!NOTE]
    > An exception to this rule occurs for lines of the form:
    > `x = k` for some constant `k`. In this case, the slope is undefined
    > `y = k` for some constant `k`. In this case, the slope is `0`

By solving the equation of the line when `x` = 0, we obtain `y = m Â· 0 + b` , so (0,b) is a point on the line. Since this point lies on the y-axis. it is the `y-axis`, it is the `y-intercept` of the line. 

This explains the name `slope-intercept` form for the line `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope and `b` is the `y-intercept`

    >> [!ANSWER]+
    >> At a quick glance, we might be tempted to say that the slope of the line is `2`. However, the give equation is not in `slope-intercept` form. In order to convert the equation into slope-intercept orm, make `y` the subject, which gives
    >> $$
    >> y = \frac{x}{2} - 3
    >> $$
    >> . Hence, the slope is `1/2` and the `y-intercept` is `-3`

> [!EXAMPLE]
    > Let `(a - 3)x -y + b - 5 = 0` be the equation of a line that forms a `DEG(45)` with the positive side of the x-axis. If the `y-intercept`is `-2` what is `a - b`?
    >> [!ANSWER]+
    >> $$
    >> \begin{align*}
>(a-3)x - y + b - 5 = 0 \\
>&y = ( a - 3)x + (b - 5) \\
>&a - 3 = \tan 45^\circ, b - 5 = -2  \\
>&a = 4, b = 3 \\
>&a - b = 4 - 3 \\
> &= 1.
\end{align*}
