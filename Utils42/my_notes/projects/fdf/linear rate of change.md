A liinear rate of change means that the value being discussed changes by a fixed amount in a given unit of time. This means that the [[slope]] of the equation will be a constant value and that a graph of the relatioship will be a straight line. 

When relationships involve a linear rate of change, it is usually simplest ot respesent them as a linear equation in [[slope-intercept form]]:

$$
y = mx + b
$$
in this formula , `y` represents our final amount, `m` is the rate of change or the slope of the line, x is the time elapsed ( in the same units as `m`), and b is the amount we started with at time `x = 0`

    > Tom makes $9 per hour. How much does tom earn if he works 20 hours ?
    >> [!ANSWER]+
    >> Since tom earns $9 per hour and work 20 hours, we can see that his wages are:
    >> $$
    >> 20 x $9 + 0= $180
    >> $$
    >> The slope being `9`and the `y-intercept`is 0 because TOM earns $9 per hour and starts out with `$0`.

    > The library loses 100 books every week. If they currently have 10,000 books, how many weaks will it be before they have only 8400 books ?
    >> [!ANSWER]+
    >> The number of books the library possesses can be expressed as the equation
    >> $$
    >> y = -100x + 10000
    >> $$
    >> to solve the problem, the value of x that corresponds to y = 8400 must be found.
    >> $$
    >> 8400 = -100x + 10000
    >> -1600 = -100x
    >> x = 16
    >> $$
    >> Thus, the answer is 16 weeks
