## Introduction
A `linear equation` is an algebric equation that forms a straight line when graphed. Each term is either a constant, or the product of a constant and a single variable.

A linear equation can have one or more dependant variables. For example, the following equations expresses the total cost of buying `a` apples at `$0.50` each and `b` bananas for $0.30 each. 
$$
Cost = {a * $0.50 + b * $0.30}.
$$
The total cost is independant and will vary if `a` or `b` is changed.
