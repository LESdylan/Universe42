Nearly all [[Scientific computation]] involve linear algebra. Consequently, linear algebra algoriths have been highly optimized. [[BLAS]] and [[LAPACK]] are the best known implementations. For improving efficiency, some of  them configure the algorithms, at run time, to adapt them to the specificites oft eh computer (`cache size`, number of available `cores`,...)
