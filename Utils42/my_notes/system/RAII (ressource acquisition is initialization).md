RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is a C++ idiom for managing resources—ensuring that resources like memory, files, or locks are acquired and released in a predictable way, usually tied to object lifetime. However, C doesn’t have classes or destructors, so we can use C idioms—such as structs and function pointers (vtable)—to mimic RAII-like patterns.

### What is a vtable in C?

A **vtable** (virtual table) is a table of function pointers. In C, it is manually created (unlike C++ where it’s generated by the compiler for classes with virtual methods). This enables something like polymorphism—different structs can have their own implementation of "methods."

### RAII in C with vtable

To implement RAII in C, we mimic the idea of "constructor" (acquisition), "destructor" (release), and method calls via a vtable.

#### 1. Define the vtable

```c
typedef struct RAII_VTable {
    void (*destroy)(void *self);
    // You can add other virtual methods here
} RAII_VTable;
```

#### 2. Define the base RAII object

```c
typedef struct RAII_Object {
    const RAII_VTable *vtable;
    // resource-specific data can go here
} RAII_Object;
```

#### 3. Implement a derived object (for example, a file resource)

```c
typedef struct FileResource {
    RAII_Object base;
    FILE *fp;
    // any other members
} FileResource;
```

#### 4. Implement the "destructor" for FileResource

```c
void FileResource_destroy(void *self) {
    FileResource *res = (FileResource *)self;
    if (res->fp) {
        fclose(res->fp);
        res->fp = NULL;
    }
    // free(res) if using dynamic allocation
}
```

#### 5. Create the vtable for FileResource

```c
const RAII_VTable FileResource_vtable = {
    .destroy = FileResource_destroy,
    // other methods if needed
};
```

#### 6. Initialize the object

```c
void FileResource_init(FileResource *res, const char *filename, const char *mode) {
    res->base.vtable = &FileResource_vtable;
    res->fp = fopen(filename, mode);
    // handle errors etc.
}
```

#### 7. Using the RAII object

```c
FileResource file;
FileResource_init(&file, "data.txt", "r");
// ... use file.fp ...

// When done, call:
file.base.vtable->destroy(&file);
```

### Key Points

- **Acquisition** is done during initialization (constructor).
- **Release** is done via the vtable’s destroy function (mimicking destructor).
- The vtable enables polymorphism, so you can have other resource types with their own destroy methods.
- You must manually call the destructor function at the end of scope, since C doesn’t have automatic object destructors (unlike C++).

### Example: Multiple Resource Types

You could define other resource types (e.g., heap-allocated buffers) with their own destroy functions and vtables, and treat them via the RAII_Object base pointer.

### Limitations

- No true automatic destruction—must manually call destroy.
- No language-enforced ownership semantics.
- Still, this vtable-based idiom makes resource management safer and more modular in C.

**Summary:**  
RAII in C using vtables involves wrapping resources in structs with a function-pointer-table for cleanup. You initialize the object (acquire resource), and later call the vtable destroy method (release resource). This allows polymorphic cleanup and modularizes resource management, although you must manually invoke destruction.
