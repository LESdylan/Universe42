# Universe42 üåå

Welcome to **Universe42**! This repository is the central hub for all the projects I will be working on throughout my journey at **Project42 School**. The goal of this repository is to showcase my growth and learning as I progress through the milestones of the 42 curriculum. 

Every project will be organized by milestone, from **Milestone 0** to **Milestone 6**, allowing you to follow my evolution as a developer and my contributions to the tech community. üöÄ

## About the Project

**Universe42** is my personal repository to gather all the projects I develop throughout my time at Project42. The idea is simple: each project showcases my ability to solve problems and develop technical skills in various domains like C, algorithms, data structures, and more.

Through this repository, you will be able to see how my skills evolve over time, from basic programming principles to more advanced software engineering concepts. This project is not only about learning but also about pushing boundaries and exploring new technologies.

## Milestones Overview

The 42 curriculum is divided into several milestones. Each milestone includes a variety of projects that aim to deepen our understanding of different aspects of software development. Below is an overview of the milestones in this repository:

### Milestone 0

Milestone 0 focuses on the foundation of programming, diving deep into C, memory management, and file handling. Expect simple, yet fundamental projects that lay the groundwork for the more complex tasks to come.

**Projects in Milestone 0:**
- Basic C programming exercises
- Intro to Git and GitHub
- Simple command-line tools and utilities

### Milestone 1

Milestone 1 introduces more advanced topics, including recursion, algorithms, and data structures. By this stage, we are expected to become comfortable with problem-solving and optimization.

**Projects in Milestone 1:**
- Recursive functions and puzzles
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Basic memory and performance optimization techniques

### Milestone 2

In Milestone 2, we get deeper into system-level programming. Topics like file descriptors, system calls, and process management are explored. At this point, I will start creating more complex software and tools.

**Projects in Milestone 2:**
- Unix-based tools and utilities
- File I/O management
- Working with low-level processes

### Milestone 3

Milestone 3 expands into more challenging projects, with a focus on software design, architecture, and multi-threading. The goal is to integrate all our prior knowledge and build real-world applications.

**Projects in Milestone 3:**
- Complex multi-threaded applications
- Design patterns and architectural structures
- Advanced algorithms and problem-solving

### Milestone 4

At this stage, I will be tackling more abstract concepts, like artificial intelligence, graphics, and databases. This is where the fun really begins, as we start making projects that can have a direct impact on the world around us.

**Projects in Milestone 4:**
- Machine learning basics
- Game development or graphical applications
- Database interaction and management

### Milestone 5

Milestone 5 allows for greater autonomy. By this point, I am expected to work on more complex systems, like network programming and distributed systems. The focus shifts towards efficiency, scalability, and system integration.

**Projects in Milestone 5:**
- Network programming (sockets, protocols)
- Distributed systems and cloud technologies
- High-performance applications

### Milestone 6

The final milestone will showcase everything learned throughout the program. This is where we build the most complete, professional-grade projects that demonstrate mastery of all areas of software development.

**Projects in Milestone 6:**
- Capstone projects with real-world applications
- Team collaborations and open-source contributions
- Full-stack development (or similar advanced topics)

In GitHub's display of submodules, the naming convention includes both the submodule directory name and the specific commit hash (e.g., libft @ 9c61f8c). Unfortunately, you cannot change this display format directly on GitHub because it's how submodules are intended to work: they are designed to show the exact commit being referenced for clarity and reproducibility.
